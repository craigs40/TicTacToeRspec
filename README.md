# Project: OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

![tttss](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71286979/110735930-be544b80-81f8-11eb-8741-78156b0c4521.png)

In this project, we've built a Tic Tac Toe game. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes.

## Getting Started:

1. To set up this game, clone this repository via the green "code" button at the top.
2. Open your Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows).
3. Navigate to the location of this clone on your machine, and run "main.rb".

## Tic Tac Toe Rules:

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. In this project, we've added numbers to the grid so the players can see which moves they will be making.
2. Player 1 will always be X, and player 2 will always be O. Players will take turns putting their marks into the numbered squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. When it is certain that there cannot be a winner, the game ends in a tie.

## Testing the Code

1. Open your Terminal or Command Prompt
2. Navigate to the location of this clone
3. run "rspec"
